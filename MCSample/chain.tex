\caption{The ATLAS simulation chain. The theoretical model is implemented in a UFO file and given as input to the generation program. Truth level analysis can be pursued, or the EVNT file can be used in a detector simulation whose outcome will be digitized in a RawData Object file and reconstructed in Event Summary Data (ESD) and Analysis Object Data (AOD). A derivation framework runs over the AOD to get the relevant events for a specific analysis. The Derivated Analysis Object Data (DAOD), which in our case is an EXOT6 file, can be made readable by RooT in a NTUPLE form.}
